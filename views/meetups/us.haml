        Join enthusiastic Elixir programmers in a supportive community. We'll learn from
        companies using Elixir in production, collaborate on open-source projects, and
        explore the nuances of Elixir essentials like OTP, Phoenix, macros, and ETS.
        Whether you're just getting curious about the language or a long-time user
        looking for a supportive and like-minded community, come join us for a night of
        short talks, programming, and concurrent networking.
