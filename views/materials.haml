%p
  There are plenty of good resources to get you started on your Elixir journey, this list
  is not exhaustive and there will certainly be plenty of things added to it  over time.


%h2
  %a{href: 'http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html'} Getting Started
%p
  The languages own guide to getting started is actually pretty thorough, and it includes
  some concepts from OTP that you will want to learn more about later.


%h2
  %a{href: 'http://elixirsips.com/'} Elixir Sips
%p
  For a small monthly fee you can get access to over 19 hours of short screencasts that
  cover some detail about, or in, Elixir.  A new one is added each week and they are
  usually small enough to squash into even the tightest of schedules.


%h2
  %a{href: 'http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642/index.html'} Elixir Etudes
%p
  A series of small examples that encourage practice in Elixir concepts, available online
  for free, but you can also purchase the book.

  libraries, to jobs.

  deal of content and a good overview of OTP.
